            <h2>More about my buisness</h2>
            <p>Some time before I joined the Hidden Genius Project, I realized that I was spending an excessive amount of time playing video games, and I thought to myself "How can I turn this passion for playing video games into money" At almost perfect timing The Hidden Genius had poped up. I took this as the perfect oppurtunity to turn my passion into a way to make money, instead of just playing the games, I wanted to be the person that makes them, and Hidden Genius could teach me how to do that. There are many different parts to video game design and I myself can't do them all so I decided to choose one. Choosing one wasn't the easiest thing either, I had to pick the aspect of video games that I care about the most. It took some thinking, but I decided on being a level designer, level designers work on how the game interacts with the player and needs to be able to make some types of buildings and props in game with 3d designer tools. Now that i've gone over how I came up with my buisness now i'll tell you how i go about doing my buisness. First people will contact me through email or solcial media then they can send me what they want meto do in regards to level desing i'll do the task and recieve the money </p>
